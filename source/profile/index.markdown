## About Me
 I know for sure that programming it's my true passion, I want to write code every day until the last day of my life.

 My first love history with a programming language was with Ruby, but then I started to play with Javascript and I realized that I loved it too, the same thing happened with frameworks (Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, etc.). I just enjoy so much learning and using any technology to make the computer bend to my will and solve real problems.

 I've been using Ruby since 2007 and I think I know it pretty well by now, I've been attending to all the Ruby conferences around my country that I could pay for, [I built a Ruby community in my city](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-cordoba), [I gave some technical talks about Ruby](http://dfmonaco.github.com/understanding_ruby_metaprogramming/#/)
, [I read almost every blog post on the planet](http://feedshare.net/dfmonaco/) and a lot of books about Ruby, [I released some open source code](http://dfmonaco.github.io/rails_presenter/)...... but I don't like to call myself a "Ruby programmer" or a "Rails Programmer" I'm just a Programmer, I can (and I want to) program in any language or framework that's best for solving the problem at hand, not because I know every language/framework, but because I enjoy learning new tools, I have what it takes, I understand the concepts and best practices behind the programming paradigms (Object Oriented, Functional, etc.) and these are common to every language, the rest it's a matter of learning new APIs and syntaxes, and I have true motivation to do that because I enjoy it.

 I like to write clean, readable, maintainable code and as decoupled as possible, I practice TDD when I think it makes sense, but I always write tests, be it before or after implementation code.

 I am a full stack web developer, most of my work has been building Rails applications from scratch, from database design (Postgresql), passing through Ruby/Rails back-end logic, until front-end work with HTML, CSS (Sass) and Javascript (Coffescript), so I can work autonomously without problems in any feature from end to end.
